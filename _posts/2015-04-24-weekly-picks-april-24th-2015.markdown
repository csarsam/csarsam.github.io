## WebTorrent
[WebTorrent](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent) is an implementation of the BitTorrent protocol that you can use in the browser via the magic of WebRTC. Kind of crazy, and 100% cooler than the frequently very cool chat and video chat apps I usually see when someone decides to do something neat with WebRTC. I listened to an interview on JSJ with the author Feross Aboukhadijeh, and ideas about what to do with it ranged from a peer-to-peer CDN to decrease bandwidth costs and load speeds for webapps to large file sharing via the browser.

## The Secret of Kells
The Secret of Kells is an animated movie by Thomas Moore, following a fictional story about the creation of the famous Book of Kells. I actually saw the Book of Kells at Trinity College Dublin four years ago, so it was nice to get a bit more historical context around the time of it's creation. I love Moore's aesthetic as usual, it's really enchanting.

## 18f
[18f](https://18f.gsa.gov/) is a goverment entity (agency? department?) doing software developement, with open developement and assorted software developement best practices. You can actually view and contribute to their codebases on GitHub - the ones I've looked at have had pretty great contribution documentation and lots of GitHub issues to tackle. This is everything I have ever wanted out of public sector development of software; transparency to stakeholders (the general public), plus the opportunity to let the citizenry help make to software tools that benefit government effectiveness & efficiency.
